AggregateSeries (Angular 2)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Demonstrates how to handle data grouping the FlexChart via a custom Series object.

The AggregateSeries is a custom series object for the Wijmo FlexChart that performs data grouping and aggregation internally when using JavaScript Date objects along the X-Axis.  In addition to this, the AggregateSeries works with the RangeSelector, automatically creating the best possible group level for a given date range.
