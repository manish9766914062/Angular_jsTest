    <h1>
        Multi-column DropDowns
    </h1>
    <p>
        Several Wijmo controls have drop-down elements that show lists, calendars, or other editors.
    </p>
    <p>
        Styling the drop-downs can be a little tricky because the drop-down elements are re-parented
        before they are displayed, and become direct children of the document body rather than of the
        control they belong to. This prevents standard CSS selectors based on the control to work for
        drop-down elements.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <b>dropDownCssClass</b> property makes this task easier. It adds a specified class name to
        the drop-downs, allowing you to style them easily with CSS.
    </p>
    <p>
        In this sample, we defined a "multi-column" CSS rule that uses the CSS Flexbox feature to turn
        regular lists into multi-column lists. The same CSS is used to style several controls, including
        a ListBox and the drop-downs used in a ComboBox, MultiSelect, and a FlexGrid.
    </p>
    <p>
        Note: IE9 does not support the CSS FlexBox feature, so all drop-downs become single-column.
    </p>

    <h2>
        Multi-column ComboBox
    </h2>
    <p>
        In this case, the "multi-column" class was applied to the drop-down rather than to the control.
        This was done using the control's <b>dropDownCssClass</b> property:
    </p>
    <wj-combo-box [dropDownCssClass]="'multi-column'" [itemsSource]="items">
    </wj-combo-box>

    <h2>
        Multi-column MultiSelect
    </h2>
    <p>
        The "multi-column" class was also specified using the control's <b>dropDownCssClass</b> property:
    </p>
    <wj-multi-select [dropDownCssClass]="'multi-column'" [itemsSource]="items">
    </wj-multi-select>

    <h2>
        Multi-column FlexGrid
    </h2>
    <p>
        The <b>FlexGrid</b> columns also have a <b>dropDownCssClass</b> property that can be used to
        style the drop-downs used to edit values in data-mapped columns. To see the multi-column editor
        in action, click one of the drop-down buttons in the "Fruit" column, or select a cell in that
        column and press F4:
    </p>
    <wj-flex-grid [itemsSource]="data">
        <wj-flex-grid-column binding="id" header="ID"></wj-flex-grid-column>
        <wj-flex-grid-column binding="fruit" header="Fruit" [dataMap]="items" [dropDownCssClass]="'multi-column'"></wj-flex-grid-column>
        <wj-flex-grid-column binding="qty" header="Qty" [dataMap]="items"></wj-flex-grid-column>
    </wj-flex-grid>

    <h2>
        Multi-column ListBox
    </h2>
    <p>
        There is no drop-down here; the "multi-column" class was added directly to the control's host element:
    </p>
    <wj-list-box class="multi-column" [itemsSource]="items">
    </wj-list-box>
</div>
